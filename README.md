The aim of this project was to create and implement an algorithm which solves the elastic Bernoulli
beam problem using Finite Element Method. The problem was divided into three phases: solving
the problem of single beam under static load, solving the problem of single beam under dynamic
load and solving the problem of structure consisting many beams.
As demonstrated in Section 6 (check finalReportSubmitted.pdf) the program created during the project is able to solve all those
types of problems including different boundary conditions and different distributions of loads. And
it is able to give the output of numerical computation in numerical and graphical form.
The results obtained with use of this program were compared with exact solutions (for the
static case), analyzed in terms of stability of energy in the system (for the dynamic case) and
compared with external software (for the structural case). Those tests show that the results are
of very good quality.
Although all goals of this project were achieved there are possible further improvements. Using
another type of basis functions would make it possible to analyze which type of basis functions
fits the best for the Bernoulli beam problem. Additional error analysis in terms of the changing
step sizes would be a good field for discussion of convergence and stability. And lastly, creating a
Graphical User Interface would make using the program much easier and more intuitive.
